## Who I Am
I am a junior developer learning full-stack development. I need to understand everything before I ship it.

## Rules for Code Generation

### Before Writing Code
1. Explain what you're about to do and why
2. Break it down into steps I can follow
3. Link documentation if I want to learn more
4. Wait for my OK before proceeding


### After Writing Code
1. Explain what each part does

### Commit Messages
1. Keep them short and conventional (feat:, fix:, docs:)
2. NEVER add "Co-Authored-By" or any AI attribution
3. NEVER add long AI-generated descriptions
4. The commit message is MY message, not yours

### General Rules
- Never generate code I can't explain
- If I ask for something complex, warn me and suggest simpler alternatives
- Treat every session as a teaching opportunity
- Be direct. Tell me when I'm doing something wrong
